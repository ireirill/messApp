## What, why and how 🤔

This project is aimed at allowing you to use a messaging app in the simplest way with no more than what you need to communicate with your team. Plus, you won't EVER get a "you've been AFK for too long" colour, so that makes it the best app made for messaging.

messApp is a project included in the Programming from Zero Bootcamp by GeeksHubs Academy where all the basics learnt for HTML5, CSS3 and JS are put into practice. This experience has made me realise how important is to get down to writting some code in order to really learn it.

It's been such a challenge for me, so I hope you enjoy it! Please feel free to make any suggestions or use it as you like.

## How to run 🚀

To run it, just download it and open the file index.html 📁. It might seem pretty simple, but it actually is.

## How to use it 🤓

Have you ever used Slack (no credits intended)? Then you know how to use this app, as we've made it even simpler so you can spend your time on other important tasks - like working.

1️⃣ First of all, click the top left ➕ to open the modal to create a new channel. You can name your channel 🏠 as you want (but please, avoid NSFW stuff). Then you click either click enter or click the button Create. You hit ➕ by mistake? No worries, just click Close.

Once you create the channel, it will appear a the left sidebar. You can create as many as you want and then select any of them.

2️⃣ You can start typing whatever you want to say to your collegues and then click enter or click the ➕ button to send the message 🗨️. The message will be stored for that channel.

3️⃣ If you send loads of messages (please don't be that kind of person), you can scroll up and down 📜 to see the historic of messages.

4️⃣ You don't know when you sent the message? Don't worry, the messages will appear with the exact date 📅 and hour 🕙 they were sent.

5️⃣ If you want to find the apple pie recipe you shared with someone, just select the search bar 🔍 at the top right and type "apple pie" and you'll easily find the message with the recipe among all the messages.

## Future updates 🆕

At some point, this app will include some back-end to make it fully operational. So... to be continued 🚧.

## Credits 💭

I'd like to thank the people at GeeksHubs Academy for this opportunity. This project has inspired me to continue with coding - so this app will be the first one of many others to come.
